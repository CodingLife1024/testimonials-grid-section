I signed upfor the free intro counrse and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks were the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</h4>

          <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
          <h4>"Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code. I needed some structire from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I did not have to wait long for their assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommend."</h4>
